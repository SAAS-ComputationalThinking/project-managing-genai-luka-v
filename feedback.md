Awesome!  This has come a long way in the last day.  It's playable (with a few bugs) and looks cool.

 * I liked having the snake image for each segment of the snake. Is there a way to bring that back?
 * Score? Make it move faster after each apple?
 * boundary conditions?

At this point:
 * Do you feel like you understand the code and how it works?
 * Do you feel that you know in general how to go about adding features or adjusting behavior/bugs?
 * Was GPT helpful?  How would you do this process differently next time?
